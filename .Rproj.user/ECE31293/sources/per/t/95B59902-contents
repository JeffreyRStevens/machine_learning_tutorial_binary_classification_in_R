{#hyperparameters} - Hyperparameters are any variable in a model that changes the accuracy and precision of a model that are not learned from the data. This is in contrast to variables in the model that are learned from the data (i.e. parameters). For example, in a random forest model the number of decision trees that you want the computer to run is a hyperparameter but the best predictor to sample at the first node of each tree is a parameter as that is what the model learns using the data. Thinking more about the best start value for different types of hyperparameters is a whole book/tutorial in itself! In fact someone wrote a [book](https://library.oapen.org/viewer/web/viewer.html?file=/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/60840/978-981-19-5170-1.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) on how to tune hyperparameters in R that is freely available. Please see this book and seek out additional resources on your own when tuning hyperparameters for your own analyses.
