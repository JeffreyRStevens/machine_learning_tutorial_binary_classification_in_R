This book takes the machine learning algorithms, no matter how complicated, and breaks them down into small, bite-sized pieces that are easy to understand. Each concept is clearly illustrated to provide you, the reader, with an intuition about how the methods work that goes beyond the equations alone. The StatQuest Illustrated Guide does not dumb down the concepts. Instead, it builds you up so that you are smarter and have a deeper understanding of Machine Learning.The StatQuest Illustrated Guide to Machine Learning starts with the basics, showing you what machine learning is and what are its goals, and builds on those, one picture at a time, until you have mastered the concepts behind self driving cars and facial recognition.",

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.",

            "abstract": "Futurists have anticipated that novel autonomous technologies, embedded with machine learning (ML), will substantially influence healthcare. ML is focused on making predictions as accurate as possible, while traditional statistical models are aimed at inferring relationships between variables. The benefits of ML comprise flexibility and scalability compared with conventional statistical approaches, which makes it deployable for several tasks, such as diagnosis and classification, and survival predictions. However, much of ML-based analysis remains scattered, lacking a cohesive structure. There is a need to evaluate and compare the performance of well-developed conventional statistical methods and ML on patient outcomes, such as survival, response to treatment, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). In this article, we compare the usefulness and limitations of traditional statistical methods and ML, when applied to the medical field. Traditional statistical methods seem to be more useful when the number of cases largely exceeds the number of variables under study and a priori knowledge on the topic under study is substantial such as in public health. ML could be more suited in highly innovative fields with a huge bulk of data, such as omics, radiodiagnostics, drug development, and personalized treatment. Integration of the two approaches should be preferred over a unidirectional choice of either approach.",

            "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (ML) methods are promising for risk-stratification, but the added benefit over traditional statistical methods remains unclear. We compared predictive models developed using machine learning (ML) methods to the Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS), a risk-tool developed with logistic regression for predicting serious adverse events (SAE) after emergency department (ED) disposition for syncope. We used the prospective multicenter cohort data collected for CSRS development at 11 Canadian EDs over an 8-year period to develop four ML models to predict 30-day SAE (death, arrhythmias, MI, structural heart disease, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage) after ED disposition. The CSRS derivation and validation cohorts were used for training and testing, respectively, and the 43 variables used included demographics, medical history, vital signs, ECG findings, blood tests and the diagnostic impression of the emergency physician. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and calibration curves. Of the 4030 patients in the training set and 3819 patients in the test set overall, 286 (3.6%) patients suffered 30-day SAE. The AUCs for model validation in test data were CSRS 0.902 (0.877–0.926), regularized regression 0.903 (0.877–0.928), gradient boosting 0.914 (0.894–0.934), deep neural network 0.906 (0.883–0.929), simplified gradient boosting 0.904 (0.881–0.927). The AUCs and calibration slopes for the ML models and CSRS were similar. Two ML models used fewer predictors than the CSRS but matched its performance. Overall, the ML models matched the CSRS in performance, with some models using fewer predictors.",

Here, we explore advances in machine learning (ML) methods and the availability of new datasets to forecast U.S. inflation. Despite the skepticism in the previous literature, we show that ML models with a large number of covariates are systematically more accurate than the benchmarks. The ML method that deserves more attention is the random forest model, which dominates all other models. Its good performance is due not only to its specific method of variable selection but also the potential nonlinearities between past key macroeconomic variables and inflation.

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.",

            "abstract": "Summary Machine learning (ML) is a collection of programming techniques for discovering relationships in data. With ML algorithms, you can cluster and classify data for tasks like making recommendations or fraud detection and make predictions for sales trends, risk analysis, and other forecasts. Once the domain of academic data scientists, machine learning has become a mainstream business process, and tools like the easy-to-learn R programming language put high-quality data analysis in the hands of any programmer. Machine Learning with R, the tidyverse, and mlr teaches you widely used ML techniques and how to apply them to your own datasets using the R programming language and its powerful ecosystem of tools. This book will get you started! Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the book Machine Learning with R, the tidyverse, and mlr gets you started in machine learning using R Studio and the awesome mlr machine learning package. This practical guide simplifies theory and avoids needlessly complicated statistics or math. All core ML techniques are clearly explained through graphics and easy-to-grasp examples. In each engaging chapter, you’ll put a new algorithm into action to solve a quirky predictive analysis problem, including Titanic survival odds, spam email filtering, and poisoned wine investigation. What’s inside Using the tidyverse packages to process and plot your data Techniques for supervised and unsupervised learning Classification, regression, dimension reduction, and clustering algorithms Statistics primer to fill gaps in your knowledge About the reader For newcomers to machine learning with basic skills in R. About the author Hefin I. Rhys is a senior laboratory research scientist at the Francis Crick Institute. He runs his own YouTube channel of screencast tutorials for R and RStudio.
